Pointers
1. Write a program that declares a double, an int, and char variables. Next declare and initialize 
a pointer to each of the three variables. Your program should then print the address of, and 
value stored in. 
2. Demonstrate addition of two floating type numbers by using call by address.
3. Demonstrate pointer arithmetic by assigning pointer “ptr” to variable “a” which is having 
value as 100 in it.Perform increment operation on pointer ptr like ptr=ptr+2 and display 
which address that pointer ptr hold
